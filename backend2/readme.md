## Motive

As a beginner, understanding Git and GitHub can be confusing — especially concepts like staging, branches, and merges.  
So, **jvcs** was created as a **simplified alternative**, offering a lightweight CLI for personal projects or learners to understand the fundamentals of version control with minimal setup and no complexity.
